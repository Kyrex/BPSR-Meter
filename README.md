## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Is using this meter a bannable offense?**
> It operates in a "gray area." It doesn't modify game files, inject code, or alter the game's memory. Historically, tools that only read data have an extremely low risk of being banned. However, **use it at your own risk.**

**Does it affect my game's performance (FPS)?**
> No. The impact is virtually zero, as packet capturing is a passive and very lightweight process.

**Why does it need to run as an administrator?**
> To allow the Npcap library to have low-level access to network adapters and monitor the game's packets.

**The meter isn't showing any data. What should I do?**
> 1. Make sure the game is running **before** you launch the meter.
> 2. Confirm that you ran the meter **as an administrator**.
> 3. Check that your firewall or antivirus isn't blocking it.
> 4. If you have multiple network connections (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, VPN), the meter might be listening on the wrong one.

**Can the meter be hidden?**
> Yes, you can hide it by clicking its icon in the taskbar.

**Can more data be hidden?**
> Yes, there are now "Advanced" and "Lite" buttons that allow you to switch between the extended and simplified versions.

**Does it work with other games?**
> No. It's specifically designed to decode the network packets for this game.

**Does it work on the Chinese server?**
> Yes, it works correctly on the Chinese server.

**Is there a version for healers?**
> Yes, when in "Lite" mode, a button will appear on the side that allows you to switch between the DPS and Healer versions. You can now optimize your rotations and see your healing per second (HPS) and total contribution.
